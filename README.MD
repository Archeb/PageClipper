## Notable features

 - more RAM & CPU intensive: with the Manifest V2, it was possible to download efficiently pages as `Blob` objects. With the Manifest V3, it's no more possible.
 - no auto-save: with the Manifest V2, it was possible to process a page in background. With the Manifest V3, it's no more possible.
 - no "Referrer" header injection: with the Manifest V2, it was possible to inject a "Referrer" HTTP header if necessary. With the Manifest V3, it's no more possible.
 - no support for fonts dynamically loaded with the `FontFace` API: with the Manifest V2, you could save on page on https://www.theverge.com/ and keep the original fonts. With the Manifest V3, it's no more possible.
 - and more to come!
